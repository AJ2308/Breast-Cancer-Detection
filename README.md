# Breast-Cancer-Detection
This repository contains implementations and resources for detecting breast cancer using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal of this project is to develop accurate and efficient models for early detection of breast cancer, aiding in timely diagnosis and treatment planning.

# Key Features:
Datasets: Curated datasets of mammography images and associated clinical data for training and evaluation.
Models: Implementation of state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models tailored for breast cancer detection.
Evaluation: Metrics and tools for evaluating model performance including sensitivity, specificity, ROC curves, and confusion matrices.
Preprocessing: Scripts and utilities for data preprocessing, including image augmentation and normalization techniques.
Deployment: Guidance and resources for deploying trained models in clinical settings or as part of diagnostic tools.
